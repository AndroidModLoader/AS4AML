AngelScript for AndroidModLoader is a project that adds A NEW scripting engine for user-scripts. It is not a replacement for Game's inner Script Engine so-called "GTAscript" but is a replacement for CLEO scripts. It is more powerful and much-much more better, but a bit slower!

Anyway, it does give you more abilities and more comfort to create code for the game.

For example, this scripting engine allows you to do game patching without actually accessing a memory address in C/C++. Currently that's hard to tell if we can implement a hooking system to it, but inventing isn't stopped yet.
